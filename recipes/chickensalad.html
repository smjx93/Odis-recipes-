    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I had chicken breasts left over from a BBQ I had and decided to make a chicken salad. I couldn't find a recipe that I liked so I played around and came up with this. It is delicious!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cooked chicken breasts, shredded</li>

        <li>2 Granny Smith apples, cut into small chunks</li>
        
        <li>2 cups chopped walnuts, or to taste</li>
        
        <li>½ red onion, chopped</li>
        
        <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        
        <li>½ cup vanilla yogurt</li>
        
        <li>5 tablespoons creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)</li>
        
        <li>5 tablespoons mayonnaise
        
        25 seedless red grapes, halved</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1
            Toss shredded chicken, apple chunks, walnuts, red onion, celery, and lemon juice together in a large bowl.</li>
            
           <li> Step 2
            Whisk vanilla yogurt, salad dressing, and mayonnaise together in a separate bowl; pour over the chicken mixture and stir to coat. Gently fold the grapes into the salad.
