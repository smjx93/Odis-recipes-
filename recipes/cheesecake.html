    <h1>New York Italian Cheescake!</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe was given to me by my Italian mother-in-law. It is the type of crustless cheesecake that is sold in Italian bakeries in New York. I usually make it with whole-milk ricotta which is creamier than low fat. This is not a diet item! You can add fresh fruit topping if you desire.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound cream cheese, softened</li>

        <li>1 pound ricotta cheese</li>
        
        <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
        
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted and cooled</li>
        
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        
        <li>2½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        
        <li>2 cups sour cream</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul><li>Step 1
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the middle of the oven.</li>
        
        <li>Step 2
        Beat the cream cheese, ricotta cheese, and sugar in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Add the butter, flour, cornstarch, and vanilla extract; mix until well combined. Fold in the sour cream and lemon juice. Pour the mixture into an ungreased 10-inch springform pan.
        </li>
    <li>       Step 3
        Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven for 2 more hours. Remove from oven and let cool completely. Run a thin spatula around the edge of the cheesecake before springing open the pan to remove. Serve at room temperature or cold; refrigerate leftovers.
